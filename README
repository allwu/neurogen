NeuroGen

NeuroGen is a FPGA platform for customized construction of neural simulation. It utilizes FPGA high-level synthesis tools to generate energy-efficient implementation of neural microcircuit simulations from a XML-based description. For technical details of this project please refer to the following paper:

H.T. Blair, J. Cong, D. Wu. FPGA Simulation Engine for Customized Construction of Neural 
Microcircuit. Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design 
(ICCAD 2013), pp. 229, November 2013.

This project is still under development, this README file will be updated when the software is available. If you have any questions, please contact Di Wu (Allan) at allwu@cs.ucla.edu

To start trying NeuroGen, follow the simple steps: 
# make 
# ./scripts/neurogen ./examples/onering.xml
