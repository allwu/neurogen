NeuroGen

NeuroGen is a FPGA platform for customized construction of neural simulation. It utilizes FPGA 
high-level synthesis tools to generate energy-efficient implementation of neural microcircuit 
simulations from a XML-based description. For technical details of this project please refer to
the following paper:

H.T. Blair, J. Cong, D. Wu. FPGA Simulation Engine for Customized Construction of Neural 
Microcircuit. Proceedings of the 2013 International Conference on Computer-Aided Design 
(ICCAD 2013), pp. 229, November 2013.

To start trying NeuroGen, follow the simple steps:

# make 
# ./scripts/neurogen ./examples/onering.xml
